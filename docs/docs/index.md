# Welder CLI

Welder is a CLI tool that allows running multi-module multi-SDK builds with the extensive use of Docker containers. 
The goal of Welder is to provide seamless build and deploy experience across environments, such as local and CI/CD.

## Why do I need another tool?
While Welder is not a CI/CD tool by itself, it is mainly focused on the build and deploy lifecycle of a 
service, trying to make the following operations easier and more streamlined:

* Build and test application using preferred containerized SDK locally and in CI/CD environment
* Build Docker images for the application
* Deploy application with the chosen deploy strategy

Please read [Motivation](/motivation/) to understand where Welder fits in the development process.
